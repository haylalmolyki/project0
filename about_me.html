      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p class="title">Programmer & Developer</p>
      <p>  my name is Hayl Almolyki</p>
      <p>  Goals are the most important thing in a personâ€™s life, without them your life would just be plain and boring not
      excitement at all. Without making goals in your life you would have nothing to look forward to, or even have anything
      to achieve. The three type of goals that I am going to cover in this essay are my personal goal which is to move out
      at the beginning of summer. My academic goal with is to get my associates degree in Computer Information System in one of
      New York University or the University of Florida. Finally my career goal, which is to major in computer information systems
      cybersecurity. Setting these goals is going to help make my life flow much easier and give me something to look forward to.</p>
      <p>
        The first goal I would like to talk about is my personal goal, moving out at the beginning of summer.
        In order for me to succeed that this goal I have to proceed with a few major and minor things.
        The first thing I must do is find a roommate someone that is not going to be a stick in the mud,
        but they will also be responsible enough to pay their part of the bills each month. This person has to be loyal
        and I have to be able to trust them with my life since after all we will be living together. Secondly,
        I have to find a place that both me and my roommate can afford each month even if we have a bad month at work
        and do not make a lot of money. The third thing i must do after I find the place I am going to stay at is
        go to the water and electric place and have all of that turned on and put the first down payment on the place down.
      </p>
      <p>
        The reasons for my interests come from my general enthusiasm for learning and reading about everything.
        I chose computer Information System because that seemed to be my strength, which derived from my curiosity in technology.
